        h4.attention_red 3. Help the best ideas reach consensus
        h4 As users repeatedly fork off proposal improvements, see new ideas and move their support, the best proposal is <i>buzzed</i> to the top.

        h2 Why it Matters
        h4 Spokenvote is a tool to help groups of any size, from a local school board to an entire nation’s people, reach consensus with radical efficiency. We think the process should be intuitive, fun, and yes, democratic.

        h4 Deeply inspired by Wikipedia, Spokenvote is an open source non-profit intended for small groups today, but over time to reach national politics. It starts with spontaneously capturing ideas as they occur to us. When we do that as a diverse group, a <i> “power of the crowd” </i> effect is introduced. The result is often a revelation of common sense that is difficult to discover from a top-down approach.
