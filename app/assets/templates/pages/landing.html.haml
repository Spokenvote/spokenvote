    %h2 How it Works
    .content_div
      %h4 First we capture your ideas, called Proposals. Then you get to organically improve the semantics of those proposals on your way toward reaching a majority opinion together. As the wording improves, the best proposals gain momentum by receiving support from multiple users and forming a clarity of consensus.

    %h2 Why it Matters
    .content_div
      %h4 Spokenvote is a tool to help groups of any size, from a local school board to an entire nation’s people, reach consensus with radical efficiency. We think the process should be intuitive, fun, and yes, democratic.
    .content_div_half
      %h4 Deeply inspired by Wikipedia, Spokenvote is an open source non-profit intended for small groups today, but over time to reach national politics. It starts with spontaneously capturing ideas as they occur to us. When we do that as a diverse group, a <i> “power of the crowd” </i> effect is introduced. The result is often a revelation of common sense that is difficult to discover from a top-down approach.
